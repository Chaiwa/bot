  <Sample Page="IntroductionPage.xaml" Title="Introduction" Description="The sample application is also a demo of sorts. The samples are populated in an XML document in TableOfContents.xml using an XmlDataProvider. Binding is used to change the content of the frame on the right when the selection changes. The content of this description Expander is also populated using the same trick. An IValueConverter is used to hide the Expander when there is no description for a given sample. The ControlTemplate for the Expander has also been modified to use the RevealDecorator so one gets a nice expand/collapse animation."/>
  <Sample Page="BlockBarPage.xaml" Title="BlockBar Control" Description="Sometimes you just want a control that does its own rendering without worrying about a template. This is an example of a control that supports all of the standard data binding tricks and also draws itself. A baseclass is used to centralize common infrastructure."/>
  <Sample Page="ColorPicker\ColorPickerPage.xaml" Title="ColorPicker Control" Description="This is ColorPicker. This control was written for my PDC'05 talk and put in the SDK. I've fixed a bunch of stuff since I posted the control for the PDC. I now use a private DP to handle the many-to-one binding of Color. I also implemented automation and cleaned up the default style (we're smarter about resources in theme files now)."/>
  <Sample Page="DateControlsPage.xaml" Title="Date Controls" Description="Two of the most requested controls have been re-born. Consider both of these controls to be high-quality samples, delivered by our friends in the Advanced Technology Center in Beijing. The controls are in the Library assembly and both have a default template that will work across themes. Feel free to use this code as you like and let me know if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions."/>
  <Sample Page="FlipTile3D\FlipTile3DPage.xaml" Title="FlipTile3D" Description="This is my first messing around with WPF 3D. Figured I'm make something cool. :-)"/>
  <Sample Page="FolderPicker\FolderPickerPage.xaml" Title="Folder Picker" Description="This is an example of building a data layer to enable data binding. In this case, around multi-selecting folders."/>
  <Sample Page="Hex\HexPage.xaml" Title="Hex" Description="Games are a great way to learn a UI framework. Hex is a great game. Find out about the rules here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)"/>
  <Sample Page="InfoTextBoxPage.xaml" Title="InfoTextBox" Description="When should I build a custom control? This is a question I get a lot. I think InfoTextBox is a great example of a where a custom control adds a lot of value. You'll notice that I didn't start from scratch. I simply added a couple of properties to the existing TextBox. The properties I add are pretty boring, actually, just HasText (bool) and TextBoxInfo (string). The magic comes when I leverage these new properties in a new ControlTemplate for InfoTextBox. I think you'll agree that the results are pretty cool."/>
  <Sample Page="KevinButton\KevinButtonPage.xaml" Title="KevinButton" Description="If you must know: http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=222817"/>
  <Sample Page="NumericUpDownPage.xaml" Title="NumericUpDown Control" Description="NumericUpDown is a control I am frequently asked about, so I thought I'd write it. I was briefly tempted to subclass RangeBase for this, but at the end of the day, one really wants Decimal to be the base value, and RangeBase uses Double. There's quite a bit going on here: lot's of nested, styled controls. Binding. Commands. RoutedEvents. DependencyProperty Coercion. Like InfoTextBox, this control and its resources lives in an external library. Feel free to reuse it. This is still a work in progress, but I think most of the work is in the style (maybe a little to handle up-down arrow keys)."/>
  <Sample Page="RadioButtonListPage.xaml" Title="RadioButtonList" Description="I've received a lot of questions about RadioButtonList (RBL). Why don't we have it as a control? The decision was a long and interesting one. At the end of the day we decided it was just too easy to build an RBL by styling a ListBox. (We had a whole host of other issues, too, but I won't bore you with them.) The power of using styling is that you can take an ordinary, data-bound ListBox and make it look like an RBL. Pretty cool."/>
  <Sample Page="RevealPage.xaml" Title="Reveal" Description="This is a great example of how a custom widget--namely, Reveal--can be used in a number of places. TreeView and Expander, for example."/>
  <Sample Page="XamlShirt.xaml" Title="XAML T-Shirt" Description="A super-simple and super-silly example of control templates gone too far."/>
  <Sample Page="ZapPage.xaml" Title="Zap Scroller" Description="An example of the union between custom elements, custom animation, and data binding."/>
