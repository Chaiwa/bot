  <Sample Page="ColorPicker\ColorPickerPage.xaml" Title="ColorPicker Control" Description="This is ColorPicker. This control was written for my PDC'05 talk and put in the SDK. I've fixed a bunch of stuff since I posted the control for the PDC. I now use a private DP to handle the many-to-one binding of Color. I also implemented automation and cleaned up the default style (we're smarter about resources in theme files now)."/>
  <Sample Page="DateControlsPage.xaml" Title="Date Controls" Description="Two of the most requested controls have been re-born. Consider both of these controls to be high-quality samples, delivered by our friends in the Advanced Technology Center in Beijing. The controls are in the Library assembly and both have a default template that will work across themes. Feel free to use this code as you like and let me know if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions."/>

  <Sample Page="FolderPicker\FolderPickerPage.xaml" Title="Folder Picker" Description="This is an example of building a data layer to enable data binding. In this case, around multi-selecting folders."/>

  <Sample Page="NumericUpDownPage.xaml" Title="NumericUpDown Control" Description="NumericUpDown is a control I am frequently asked about, so I thought I'd write it. I was briefly tempted to subclass RangeBase for this, but at the end of the day, one really wants Decimal to be the base value, and RangeBase uses Double. There's quite a bit going on here: lot's of nested, styled controls. Binding. Commands. RoutedEvents. DependencyProperty Coercion. Like InfoTextBox, this control and its resources lives in an external library. Feel free to reuse it. This is still a work in progress, but I think most of the work is in the style (maybe a little to handle up-down arrow keys)."/>
  <Sample Page="ZapPage.xaml" Title="Zap Scroller" Description="An example of the union between custom elements, custom animation, and data binding."/>
