The **[Bag of Tricks](http://github.com/thinkpixellab/bot)** (BOT) Started in December 2005. [Kevin](http://github.com/kevmoo) was working at Microsoft on v1 of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). He was blogging a lot of code samples and wanted to keep them all together and ensure everything kept working as features changed and evolved as WPF moved towards shipping.

The **BOT** grew to be an important resource for those learning and pushing the capabilities of WPF.

It now includes a set of helper libraries that are generally useful for .NET programming with an emphasis on building GUI applications targetting WPF (v4), Silverlight (v4) and Windows Phone 7.

It is actively maintained by [Kevin](http://github.com/kevmoo) and your friends at [Pixel Lab](http://thinkpixellab.com "Pixel Lab").

### Code Contracts
Parts of the **Bag of Tricks** are built using [Code Contracts](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/devlabs/dd491992.aspx). You may wish to install and use these tools when you are working with **BOT**.
